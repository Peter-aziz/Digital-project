//1. [10 Points] Read in (and validate) a Boolean function given as Assume that the variable name is a single Latin letter starting from “a”.Think about the checkers needed to validate the inputand list them in your report.

//2.[10 Points] Print the truth table of the function as well as the canonical SoP and PoS.

//3.[20 Points] Generate and print all prime implicants(PIs).For each PI show the minterms it covers as well as its binary representation.

//4.[15 Points] Using the PIs generated in part 2, obtainand print all the essential prime implicants EPIs(as Boolean expressions).

//5.[5 Pts] Print the minterms that are not covered by the essential PIs.

//6.[10 Points, Bonus] Solve the PI table and print the minimized Boolean expression of the Boolean function using the 3 - step heuristic discussed in the lecture.

//7.[5 Pts] Draw the K - Map showing the solution(up to 4 variables)

//8.[5 Pts] Draw the logic circuit of the minimized function(up to 10 variables); you may use https ://wavedrom.com/tutorial2.html
